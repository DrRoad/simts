# `simts` Overview <a href="https://smac-group.com/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%"/></a>

The Time Series Tools (`simts`) R package provides a series of tools to simulate, plot, estimate, select and forecast different time series models. More specifically, it provides the following features:

* Simulation of time series from SARIMA models to various state-space models that can be expressed as latent time series processes.
* Visualization of time series data with user specifications.
* Specific simulation and visualization tools for latent time series models.
* Easy-to-use functions to estimate and infer on the parameters of time series models through different methods
* Diagnostic and statistical tools to assess goodness of fit and select the best model for the data
* Estimating and plotting tools to deliver point forecasts and confidence intervals

To understand the usage of the `simts` package, please refer to the "Vignettes" tabs above.

## Install Instructions

To install the `simts` package, there is currently one option: [GitHub](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/simts/). For users who are interested in having the latest developments, this option is ideal although more dependancies are required to run a stable version of the package. Most importantly, users **must** have a (C++) compiler installed on their machine that is compatible with R (e.g. Clang).

*The setup to obtain the development version of `simts` is platform dependent.*

**All Systems**

The following R packages are also required. Once you've made sure that you have a compatible C++ compiler, run the following code in an R session and you will be ready to use the devlopment version of `simts`.

```{r, eval = F}
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo","devtools","knitr","rmarkdown"))

# Install the package from GitHub without Vignettes/User Guides
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/simts")

# Install the package with Vignettes/User Guides 
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/simts", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
